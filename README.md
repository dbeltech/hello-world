dbeltech a new adventure
I am brand new to GitHub, the world of coding, and application development. My past experience is in computer repair and networking but I have always had an interest in learning about coding. I have recently also become interested in some of the developments occuring in the blockchain, I just feel encouraged to get more involved in new areas.
